# Adopt Don't Shop Paired Project
BE Mod 2 Week 2/3 Pair Project

## Background and Description

"Adopt Don't Shop Paired" is a fictitious pet adoption platform where visitors can favorite pets and apply to adopt their newest furry friend.

Students will be put into pairs to complete the project.

## Learning Goals

### Rails

* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
* Make use of flash messages


* Use Inheritance from ApplicationController or a student created controller to store methods that will be used in multiple controllers

### ActiveRecord
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to:
    * create queries that calculate, select, filter, and order data from a single table

### Databases
* Describe Database Relationships, including the following terms:
    * Many to Many
    * Join Table

### Testing and Debugging
* Write feature tests utilizing
* Sad Path Testing
* Write model tests with RSpec including validations, and class and instance methods

### Web Applications
* Describe and implement ReSTful routing
* Identify use cases for, and implement non-ReSTful routes
* Identify the different components of URLs(protocol, domain, path, query params)

## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.2.4.3
- must use PostgreSQL
- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use good GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and use of a project planning tool

## Permitted

- use FactoryBot to speed up your test development
- use "rails generators" to speed up your app development

## Not Permitted

- do not use JavaScript for pagination or sorting controls

## Permission

- if there is a specific gem you'd like to use in the project, please get permission from your instructors first

## Setup
This project builds off of the solo project, Adopt Don't Shop. Between you and your partner, choose which one of your repos you'd like to use. If you choose to use Partner A's solo project, Partner A will clone their project into a new directory and push up to a new repo on github. Then, Partner A should add Partner B as a collaborator to that project.

## User Stories

```
[ ] done

User Story 1, Deploy your application to Heroku

As a visitor or user of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the application on Heroku.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the application must be hosted on Heroku.
```

## Users

Our Application is going to need to track who is using it. To that end, we are going to create a `users` table. A User should have a name, street address, city, state, and zip.

In a fully functioning web application, users would normally need to log in with a password in order to do anything associated with that user's account. However, in this project we will not be adding any log in functionality.

Also notice that all User stories start with "As a visitor". A "visitor" is someone who is not logged into a user account. Since we are not adding any log in functionality, anyone using our application is considered a "visitor".

```
User Story 2, User Show Page

As a visitor
When I visit a User's show page
Then I see all that User's information
Including the User's
  - Name
  - Street Address
  - City
  - State

User Story 3, New User

As a visitor
When I visit '/users/new'
I see a form to create a new user
When I fill in the form with my
  - Name
  - Street Address
  - City
  - State
  - Zip
Then I am taken to my new user's show page
And I see all of the information I entered in the form
```


## Shelter Reviews

Users will be able to share their experiences with a shelter through providing reviews. Users should be able to create a review with a title (Example: "Awesome place!"), a rating (out of 5), and content (Example: "Truly enjoyed our time working with this shelter. Staff was great, and we found our perfect pet!"). A user can also upload one picture (image url address) for their review as well, but this is optional.

A review should belong to a Shelter, and belong to a User.

## Approving Applications

Pets on an application can either be accepted or rejected. Once all pets on an application have been marked either accepted or rejected, then the application is no longer "Pending". If all the pets were accepted, then the application is accepted. If one or more pets on the application is rejected, then the entire application is rejected.

For this set of stories, we will be making routes that begin with '/admin'. This is to indicate that only a user with special privileges should be able to accept or reject pets on an application. Normally, we would want to make sure that a user is logged into an admin account before being able complete any of this workflow, but we will not add any log in or authorization functionality to this project.

## Rubric
Note: In order to get 4's criteria under 4's must be completed.

| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including all sad paths and edge cases, and some extension work completed | Students implement strategies not discussed in class to effectively organize code using POROs and adhere to MVC | Highly effective and efficient use of ActiveRecord beyond what we've taught in class. Even `.each` calls will not cause additional database lookups. | Very clear Test Driven Development. Test files are extremely well organized and nested. Students utilize `before :each` blocks. 100% coverage for features and models |
| **3: Passing** | Students complete all User Stories. No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement sad path and edge case functionality. | Students use the principles of MVC and POROs vs. Models to effectively organize code. Students can defend any of their design decisions. Action View helpers are used. Routes and Actions are following RESTful conventions. | ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data using no Ruby to process data. Project fully leverages AR associations and methods | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. Scored a 3 or higher in Feature Completeness |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students complete all but 1 - 3 User Stories | Students utilize MVC and POROs to organize code, but cannot defend some of their design decisions. Some routes and actions are not restful. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. |
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete 4 or more User Stories | Students do not effectively organize code using MVC and/or POROs | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. |
